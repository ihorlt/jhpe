		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>Having made experimental studies by modern measuring instruments at the existing pipeline we obtained pressure change
regularities during unsteady hydrodynamic processes taking into account operation technology and characteristics of domestic oil
pipeline pumping equipment.</p>
<p>There have been studied regularities of the rotor speed and pressure of NM oil pumps variations over time at their starting.
There is revealed the change in transported oil pressure over time at the inlet and outlet of a pumping station during pumping
units startings.</p>
<p>There have been built exponential dependences of the value of abrupt reduction and increase of oil pressure on the distance
to the place of disturbance occurrence. The intensity of a low and high oil pressure wave damping in the pipeline are estimated.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>Keywords</h4>
		<p>a high-pressure wave, abrupt increase in pressure, the attenuation coefficient of the wave, unsteady hydrodynamic
processes, velocity of propagation of a high-pressure wave.</p>
