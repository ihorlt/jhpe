		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>This paper describes an overview of particular solutions and approaches to dealing with the issue of carbon dioxide storage
options in the Slovak Republic. It also deals with the options of capture and subsequent storage of carbon dioxide in underground
geological formations. The Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, which seems to be very promising in this context, is
one of such technologies. Smaller or larger CCS projects are carried out in different countries around the world. This contribution
emphasizes the overview of solutions and approaches to the issue of dealing with CO 2 and options of its storage in Slovakia.
Concept of CO 2 storage in deep geological formations has both its supporters and opponents. Global climate changes will likely
be a very important factor that could significantly change the life conditions on the Earth.</p>
