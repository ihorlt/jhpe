		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>The article investigates the influence of ultrasonic treatment and electromagnetic radiation on the adhesive strength of
epoxy composite coatings in oil and gas sector, containing fine-particles. The results of research have been analyzed, optimal
composition and type of treatment of epoxy polymer composition on the stage of formation have been selected. The introduction
of high particle content ensures optimal significant improvement of study characteristics that indicate the future of research in
this area and the feasibility of formation of high quality protective epoxy composite coatings.</p>
