		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>Numerical modeling of water alternating-gas processes requires adequate representation of dependencies of relative phase
        permeability for oil, gas and water upon saturation of the reservoir. On the basis of the agreement of the results of numerical
        modeling with laboratory experiments parameterization of Korea functions for phase permeability of Eocene sandstone for oil,
        gas and water at pressure below the saturation pressure has been carried out. Correlation between meters of membership
        functions with initial gas saturation, formed as a result of the allocation of oil dissolved gas, has been established.</p>
