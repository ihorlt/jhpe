		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>New methodology of designing of the differential pressure flowmeters, which are optimal as to the accuracy of flowrate
measurement is developed in order to provide minimum uncertainty of flowrate measurement results. This methodology is
implemented in “Raskhod-RU” CAD system for computer aided design and calculation of differential pressure flowmeters.
“Raskhod-RU” CAD meets the requirements of the new Standards (DSTU GOST 8.586.1,2,3,4,5–2009 and GOST
8.586.1,2,3,4,5–2005) and provides accomplishment of the following tasks: verification of conditions (constraints) for the
application of the differential pressure method according to the requirements of the new Standards; calculation of primary
device parameters, pipe straight lengths and flowmeter in general according to the requirements of the new Standards;
calculation of uncertainty of fluid flowrate and volume measurement results; design of an optimal flowmeter as to the
accuracy of flowrate measurement.</p>
