		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>Contaminated areas of anthropogenic origin, particularly surface and underground waters as well as soils, have been
        analyzed. The mathematical models of diffusion processes, based on the use of two- and three-dimensional diffusion equations
        with a wide range of boundary and initial conditions, have been suggested. It is determined that exact solutions prohibit studying
        of the peculiarities of their behavior, depending on the type of boundary conditions; therefore we suggest using numerical
        solutions. The difference schemes of the method of variable directions for numerical realization of two-dimensional models in
        different frames, accounting for environmental heterogeneity of matter distribution have been presented. The schemes allow to
        measure concentration of substances in real objects through building of functions, modeling various boundary conditions. A
        software complex for their implementation has been devised and the test findings as well as their analysis have been presented.
        To model processes which parameters depend on three spatial coordinates, we have suggested numerical schemes for
        implementing three-dimensional models that are absolutely stable and have the second order of accuracy at all spatial
        coordinates.</p>
