		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>In case of the long-term operation of pipelines under the influence of alternating loads and degradation of service
characteristics of material there originate residual stresses and strains that can lead to the loss of its bearing capacity in pipes. One
of the ways to increase the structural strength of pipelines is to strengthen the pipe by banding, which results in the need to
develop methods for calculating the structural parameters of the pipeline â€“ bandage system. This paper presents a mathematical
model to estimate the strength of the pipeline-composite bandage system, based on the improved theory of thin shells with regard
to shear and compression pliability of material. The solution allows us to simulate the stress state of a finite-length pipeline based
on the given original characteristics of the pipes` material, composite, operational loads and effects. </p>
