		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>The problem of segmentation (splitting the signal into specific zones, segments) of the cyclic random process with a
segmental structure is being described.</p>
<p>There have been introduced several approaches to solving the problem of segmenting the cyclic random process. In
particular, they include cyclic and periodic partially stationary random processes. Examples of segmenting simulated and real
signals are also provided.</p>
<p>The results can be used in automated processing systems (diagnosis and prognosis) of electrocardiosignals, cyclic economic
processes, gas and energy consumption processes, diagnostics of the topographic surface of modern materials.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4>Keywords</h4>
		<p>cyclic random process, segment structure, segmentation.</p>
