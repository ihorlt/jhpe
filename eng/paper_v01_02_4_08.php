		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>Floods and overflow forecasting is a live issue in Ukraine today. There is offered the system of monitoring and forecasting
of water levels in rivers to solve this issue. The computer system enables automated acquisition of information about weather
conditions and forecasts a future river level. The computer system is based on the method of mathematical models making using
genetic algorithms. The use of genetic algorithms ideas for making mathematical models enables us both to choose the optimal
structure for an adequate model and to reduce significantly the number of calculations when the models are iterated. The system
is implemented for monitoring and forecasting of water levels in rivers of the Precarpathian region. Implementation of an
automated system will reduce flood damage and improve efficiency of flood situations management.</p>
