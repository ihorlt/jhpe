		<h4><strong>Optimization of equipment availability of a gas-pumping unit</strong></h4>

		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>The control of mechanical equipment availability is based on the knowledge of its behaviour and thus optimizes the timing
of corrective intervention. The equipment can operate both in good conditions and even in the state of degradation, causing the
unscheduled high-cost intervention at any moment. During our study we have optimized turbocharger availability by
probabilistic modelling based on the turbocharger`s state parameters that define its degradation. </p>
