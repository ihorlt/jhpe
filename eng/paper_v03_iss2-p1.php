		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>The principles of quality assessment of well drilling operations have been reviewed and four-grade evaluation system
        (very high, high, satisfactory, unsatisfactory) has been suggested. The model for interpretation of rotational viscosimetry data
        using criteria of transformed disreptancy and results of analysis of matrices of rheological properties estimates covariations has
        been summarized. The article describes how to build equations of state of rheological properties on the basis of the results of
        rotational viscosimetry data treatment for the plan of experiment. General formulas for calculation of biviscosity fluids steady
        flow in circular cylindrical and annular pipes have been presented.</p>
