		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>Surface tention (ST) is a physical-chemical parameter that informs about the presence of surface-active agents (surfactants)
in the aqueous environment. The article proposes to obtain experimentally ST (IST) time dependence of the controlled aqueous
environment and to judge by the equilibrium ST value (EST) about the surfactant concentration in such an environment, based on
the previously received calibration dependence of EST on the concentration of respective surfactant in the aqueous environment.
EST dependence of controlled aqueous environment is recommended to get though ST measurements by pulsing meniscus
method based on the measurement of maximum pressure in the bubble (MPB) without its separation.The essence of pulsing
meniscus method has been described. The advantage of this method over usual MPB method is that in the process of obtaining
IST dependence and EST value one should use the same air meniscus surface at the end of metering capillary submerged in the
sample of the investigated aqueous environment. It considerably speeds up the process of getting IST dependence and EST value
of aqueous environment. The article contains a block diagram, appearance and work description of a device that implements
pulsing meniscus method with the application of microcontrollers and hydraulic damper of depth of the metering capillary
submersion in the controlled aqueous environment. Calculation of ST value on the basis of the measured maximum pressure drop
∆pmax in the meniscus pulsation process could be accomplished by one of the proposed dependences and methods
(M. Cantor, R. Feustel, E. Schrödinger, J. Dugne, S. Sudgen, R. Bendure, I. Kisil). Recommended ranges of values for the
parameter ∆ρgr ∆pmax have been demonstrated, where relative methodological error of the calculation results of ST values will
not exceed 0.1%, where ∆ρ is the densities difference of the controlled aqueous environment and air, g is the acceleration of
free fall and r is an outlet radius of the device metering capillary.</p>
