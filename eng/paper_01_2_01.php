		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>With the use of ideas of stepwise recording of process and medium characteristics, the methodology of mathematical modelling of filtration and mass-exchanging processes in a formation wellbore zone has been suggested. The methodology
considers thermodynamic effects which appear as a result of gas throttling through micro fractures of shale rock when, on condition of quasistationary filtration flow, displacement process is described by specially modified Darcy's law with critical
gradient.</p>
<p>Model problem of hydrodynamic effects investigation in a formation wellbore zone in case of gas filtration in a formation with low permeability has been formulated. On the example of radial gas flow the peculiarities of temperature field division
algorithm building have been illustrated.</p>

		<h4>Keywords</h4>
		<p>Joule-Thomson effect, iteration method, non-linear filtration, sedimentary shale rock</p>
