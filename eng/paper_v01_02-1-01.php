		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>The article describes the schemes of the effective thickness distribution of Paleogene sediments within the first and the second structure stages of the northwestern Inner zone of the Carpathian foredeep basin</p>
		<p>The character of reservoir rocks distribution is studied; the conditions of their formation and the main patterns of their spatial distribution, features of filtration and capacitance properties are clarified.</p>
		<p>The results have been the basis for the allocation of oil and gas objects within the chosen area of study.</p>
		<p>There are distinguished 9 new oil and gas perspective objects; their spatial position is confirmed by the presence of gas geochemical anomalies.</p>
		<p>The amount of total prospective resources in allocated objects at the depths of 2 to 5 km are 4,200,000 tons of oil.</p>
		<p>The main ranking criteria of the objects have been the depth, size and prospective resources of the object as they determine the economic feasibility of drilling.</p>

		<h4>Keywords</h4>
		<p>effective thickness, filtration and capacitance properties, oil and gas bearing object, prospective resources.</p>
