		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>The article reviews basic properties of nanocellulose, indicates sources of raw materials and peculiarities of its formation. It
has been found out that the main factors that determine the size and structure of nanocellulose is the raw material, the conditions
of treatment and methods of generation of nanoscale crystals.</p>
        <p>It has been demonstrated that cellulose nanoparticles can be used as environmentally friendly additives for water-based
drilling fluids with predetermined rheological and filtration properties, as well as corresponding thermal resistance, which
increases the efficiency of drilling technology.</p>
        <p>It has been noted that the nanocomposite material "cellulose – polyethylene" can be raw material for the production of a
new generation of plastic pipes with better strength characteristics and high resistance to slow and rapid crack propagation if
compared to traditional materials.</p>
