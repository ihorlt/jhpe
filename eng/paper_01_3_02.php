		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>The pipelines, the working conditions of which are significantly different from the conditions of the majority of the existing systems are considered in this article. In this article, the gas pipelines with large difference in elevation that operate at high
(5–15 MPa) and ultrahigh pressures (up to 25–35 MPa) are taken into the account. First of all, deep and gas pipelines that overcome the high mountain passes are considered. The theory and algorithm for calculating the steady-state operations of such pipelines are presented.</p>

		<h4>Keywords</h4>
		<p>differential equations, equation of state, gas pipeline “South Stream”, high and ultra-high-pressures, Joule-Thomson coefficient, numerical algorithm, profile of the gas pipeline</p>
